# Welcome to my application, the road and field classification 

This folder is divided into two parts :
 - The first project (field_road_classifier_pytorch) is a binary classification model coded in PyTorch with a PyTorch Lightning wrapper (just for demo purposes, 
 I didn't have time to train or improve it).
 
 - The second project (field_road_classifier_tf) is a binary classification model coded in Tensorflow. 
 It has been trained and this is the one that will be used for inference (contains the weights).
